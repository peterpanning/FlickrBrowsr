A simple image browser built using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for v5 of the Qt application framework from The Qt Company.

Uses Python3, the PyQt5 library, and the [flickrapi](https://stuvel.eu/flickrapi-doc/1-intro.html) python module, which requires Requests and Six. 

May need pyopenssl to connect to flickr, use `pip install pyopenssl`. 

Install PyQt5 and the flickrapi using pip3, as in `pip install [package]`.

If necessary, install pip3 as appropriate for your package manager.
